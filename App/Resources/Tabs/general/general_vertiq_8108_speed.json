The motor will behave the same way throughout the life of a battery, assuming the commanded voltage is less than the battery voltage. You must set the Max Voltage setting in the Tuning tab.\n\nVelocity Mode: Closed-loop, commands a velocity. The controller will adjust the applied voltage so that the motor spins at the commanded velocity. This mode has faster reaction times. Only use this if you know the properties of your propeller.
